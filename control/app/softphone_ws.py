"""Relay the browser softphone's SIP-over-WebSocket to its line's engine.

The browser only ever talks to the control surface origin (HTTPS, or a reverse proxy in front
of it) and picks a line by path. Each engine's Asterisk serves plain WS on its docker-bridge
address, which is never published to the host, so this relay is the only way in. That keeps a
single TLS hop and a single certificate (the WebUI's), and one path per line instead of one
host port per line.
