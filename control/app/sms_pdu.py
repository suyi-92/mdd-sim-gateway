"""Telling a text message apart from a machine payload that merely looks like one.

Not every SMS is meant for a person. Carriers and services also send binary ones — SIM
OTA data-download, silent app pushes, WAP push — whose user data is arbitrary bytes, not
characters. The PDU says which is which in TP-DCS (3GPP TS 23.038 section 4) and TP-PID
(TS 23.040 9.2.3.9), but Asterisk's parse_tpdu() unpacks an 8-bit payload one byte per
character and hands back a string, so by the time the manager sees it a binary payload is
indistinguishable from a text that happens to be mojibake. Line 1 collected 16 of these
from short-codes 2942/2939 before the engine started forwarding the header fields.

The engine's Asterisk patch (engine/patches/asterisk/mt_concat_udh.py) now exposes TP-PID,
TP-DCS, the UDH and the raw PDU; this module turns those into the one decision the manager
needs — is this a text to show, or a payload to file away — and falls back to inspecting the
decoded body for an engine image that predates the patch.
