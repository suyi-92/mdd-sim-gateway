"""The push that publishes a subscriber identifier is the one that has to be stopped.

CI has scanned for these since v1.3.15, but it reports after the fact: a push cannot be taken
back, and rewriting the branch afterwards leaves the object reachable by its SHA for a while.
A real MSISDN reached an open pull request that way. Worse, by the time it was noticed the
working tree was already clean — the value only survived in an earlier commit's blob — so a
tree scan would have called the branch safe. These cover the check against the commits being
pushed, and the hook that runs it.
