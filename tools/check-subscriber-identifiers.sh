# Fail if a real subscriber identifier looks like it has been committed.
#
# RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md has always required this scan, but it was a manual step that nothing
# enforced -- so a real MSISDN pair, six ICCIDs and three modem IMEIs sat in the test fixtures
# from the initial public release through v1.3.15 without anyone noticing. A rule that only
# lives in a document is a rule that gets skipped; this runs in CI instead.
#
# The check is deliberately shaped to fail LOUDLY on anything it cannot recognise as fictional,
# because the cost of a false positive (add it to the allow-list below, with a reason) is far
# lower than the cost of a miss (a subscriber identifier published irrevocably).
#
# Usage: tools/check-subscriber-identifiers.sh [path...]   (default: git-tracked source files)
#        tools/check-subscriber-identifiers.sh --commits <git rev-list arguments...>
#
# The --commits form scans every blob those commits introduce, which is what hooks/pre-push
# uses. Scanning the working tree is not enough before a push: a value that was committed and
# then removed is still in the history being published, and a push cannot be taken back.

Each value above is either a real subscriber identifier -- which must not be committed, see
docs/DEVELOPMENT.md -- or a fictional one this check does not recognise. If it is
fictional, make that evident: zero-fill the body, or add the pattern to the allow-list in
tools/check-subscriber-identifiers.sh together with the reason it is safe.
