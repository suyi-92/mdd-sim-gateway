"""
pin_keeper.py - Keep the USIM CHV1 (PIN) verified for the whole engine lifetime.

Why: swu_ike's EAP-AKA (IKE) and Asterisk's ims_aka (SIP) both run AUTHENTICATE against
the USIM, which requires CHV1 verified. Empirically, PIN verification persists at the card
level across separate PC/SC connections as long as the card stays powered. So we verify
once, then hold an idle connection open and only re-verify when the card is re-inserted /
reset. We do NOT poll with SELECTs (that would race with swu_ike/ami_usim APDU sequences,
which pcscd does not serialize as groups).

Config via env (set by entrypoint from /config/instance.json):
  USIM_PIN        - the CHV1 PIN (digits). If empty/"none", PIN is assumed disabled.
  USIM_READER     - exact PC/SC reader name, "imsi:<IMSI>", "iccid:<ICCID>", or
                    integer reader index. Default 0.
  MDD_RUNDIR   - status dir (default /run/mdd-sim-gateway)

Writes JSON status to $MDD_RUNDIR/pin_status.json:
  {"state": "...", "tries_left": N, "reader": "...", "ts": ...}
States: NO_READER, NO_CARD, PIN_DISABLED, VERIFIED, WRONG_PIN, PIN_BLOCKED, ERROR
Exit code is always 0 while running; it loops forever. A non-recoverable PIN problem
(WRONG_PIN / PIN_BLOCKED) is reported in status and the process keeps running so the
manager can surface it (it will retry on next card insert).
