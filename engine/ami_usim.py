"""
ami_usim.py - Bridge Asterisk (ims_aka) SIP authentication to the physical USIM via PC/SC.

Derived from phcoder/asterisk-docker (jolly). Changes:
  - VERIFY CHV1 (PIN) after selecting ADF.USIM, before AUTHENTICATE (reference didn't).
  - Clean type-annotation bug from the original (undefined Hexstr/Optional names).
  - Emit status/heartbeat JSON to $MDD_RUNDIR/usim_status.json for the manager FSM.

On Asterisk 'AuthRequest' it runs USIM AUTHENTICATE and returns RES/CK/IK (or AUTS on
sync failure). Triggers registration on FullyBooted and confirms dedicated bearers.
